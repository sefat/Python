# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Addition

print (4+5)

a = 5
b = 5
print (a+b)


# Subtraction

print (5-4)

a = 5
b = 4

print (a-b)


# Multiplication

a = 5
b = 4
print (a*b)


# Division

a = 21
b = 4
print (a/b)

# To set the result as an integer
print (int(a/b)) 


# Modulus - means the remainder after the division

a = 23
b = 5

print (a%b)


#Exponentiation - means a to the power b in the following example

a = 3
b = 2
print (a**b)


#Floor division - sort of rounding off to the floor value

a = 6
b = 2

print (a//b)
